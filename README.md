I'm a low-level programmer.

While my favorite language is C, I do work in C++ and C# sometimes, and I'm working on honing my assembly skills.
My favorite microprocessor is the MOS Technology 6502, and I spend way too much time reading up on it.

Follow me for some potentailly interesting code bits (or just general video game trivia, either one works really).

Projects in the works:

-Working on my Assembly skills

-Adding more C programs to my code repository

-Secret NES project

-???
